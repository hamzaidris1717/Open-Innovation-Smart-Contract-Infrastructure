## 📈 Usage Examples

### Creating an Innovation Project
```typescript
// Example: Create a sustainable energy innovation project
const title = "Solar-Powered IoT Network";
const description = "Decentralized IoT network powered by renewable solar energy with blockchain integration";
const fundingGoal = 5000000; // 5M microSTX
const deadlineBlocks = 100000; // ~70 days
const category = "clean-tech";

await contractCall({
  contractAddress: "ST1234...",
  contractName: "open-innovation-infrastructure",
  functionName: "create-innovation-project",
  functionArgs: [title, description, fundingGoal, deadlineBlocks, category],
  postConditionMode: PostConditionMode.Allow
});
```

### Joining a Collaboration
```typescript
// Join project #0 with 25% contribution weight
await contractCall({
  contractAddress: "ST1234...",
  contractName: "open-innovation-infrastructure",
  functionName: "join-collaboration",
  functionArgs: [0, 25] // project-id: 0, contribution-weight: 25%
});
```

### Submitting Innovation Proposals
```typescript
// Submit implementation proposal
const proposalTitle = "Hybrid Solar-Battery System";
const proposalDesc = "Integration of advanced battery storage with solar panels";
const implementationPlan = "Phase 1: Research & Development (30 days), Phase 2: Prototype Development (45 days), Phase 3: Testing & Optimization (25 days)";
const requestedFunding = 2000000; // 2M microSTX

await contractCall({
  contractAddress: "ST1234...",
  contractName: "open-innovation-infrastructure",
  functionName: "submit-innovation-proposal",
  functionArgs: [0, proposalTitle, proposalDesc, implementationPlan, requestedFunding]
});
```

### Registering Intellectual Property
```typescript
// Register IP with blockchain protection
const ipHash = "0x1234567890abcdef..."; // SHA-256 hash of IP document
const licenseTerms = "MIT License - Free for non-commercial use, attribution required";

await contractCall({
  contractAddress: "ST1234...",
  contractName: "open-innovation-infrastructure",
  functionName: "register-ip",
  functionArgs: [0, ipHash, licenseTerms] // project-id: 0
});
